Create a Cron Job
The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

Solution
Do this for all app servers

# SSH into app server 1
ssh tony@stapp01

# Switch to root user
# sudo su -

# Install cronie
yum install -y cronie

# Start crond service
systemctl start crond

# Check crond service
systemctl status crond

# This will allow us to add a cron job
crontab -e

# then add this to the file
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text

# to verify if cronjob is created successfully
crontab -l -u root

# watch the folder to check if our cronjob is working as expected
watch -n 5 ls -l /tmp

# After 5 seconds, we will see a new file called cron_text

# Check if a cron job is created for the root user in cron directory
ls /var/spool/cron
cat /var/spool/cron/root
