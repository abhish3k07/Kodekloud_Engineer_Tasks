Disable Root Login
After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH.

Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.

Solution
Perform these steps on all app servers

# SSH to app server 1
ssh tony@stapp01

# Edit the etcsshsshd_config and change change PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no, Uncomment if commented
sudo vi etcsshsshd_config

# Check if the changes are applied
sudo cat etcsshsshd_config  grep PermitRoot

# Reload configuration
sudo systemctl reload sshd

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status sshd

# Exit the app server
exit
