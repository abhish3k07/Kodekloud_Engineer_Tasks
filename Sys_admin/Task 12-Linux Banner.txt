											Linux Banner
During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.

Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /root/nautilus_banner on jump host

Solution
Do this on all app servers

# Check banner file defails on host
ll -lsd /tmp/nautilus_banner

# Copy banner to the /tmp directory on app server 1
sudo scp -r /root/nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:/tmp

# Run move command on the app server 1
ssh -t tony@stapp01 'sudo mv /tmp/nautilus_banner /etc/motd'

# Validate
ssh tony@stapp01

# You should see the banner now

# If incase, scp fails, the most proable reason is that ssh client is not installed
sudo yum install openssh-clients
