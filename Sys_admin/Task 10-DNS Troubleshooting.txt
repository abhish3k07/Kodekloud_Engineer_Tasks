DNS Troubleshooting
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.

As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS. Please make appropriate changes on this server.

Solution
# SSH to app server 3.
ssh banner@stapp03

# Verify if DNS is really not working by doing a ping test.
ping www.google.com

# Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add nameserver for Google
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
# add nameserver 8.8.8.8

# Test connectivity
ping www.google.com

#   Exit from server
exit
