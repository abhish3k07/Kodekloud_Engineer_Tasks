Linux User Without Home
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

Create a user named kareem in App Server 1 without a home directory.

Solution
# SSH into App server 1
ssh tony@stapp01

# Create user without a home directory
sudo useradd -M kareem

# Verify that home directory is not created
ls -l /home

# Exit the app server
exit
