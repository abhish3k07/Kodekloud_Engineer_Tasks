A developer John has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource.
 As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for John.
 Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user will not be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named john on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to 2021-12-07 in Stratos Datacenter.
Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

# SSH to App server 1
ssh tony@stapp01

# Add user with expiry
sudo useradd -e 2021-12-07 john 

# If the user already exists then use the following command
sudo chage -E 2021-12-07 john 

# verify
sudo chage -l john 

# Exit the app server
exit
